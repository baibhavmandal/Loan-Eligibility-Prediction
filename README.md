# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

This project aims to predict the loan eligibility of customers based on their personal and financial information. The dataset used in this project consists of historical data of loan applicants, including features such as gender, income, credit history, loan amount, loan term, and others.

The project was implemented using Python and several popular data science libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Missingno, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn**. The data was first preprocessed using Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values, and other data quality issues. Exploratory data analysis was performed using Matplotlib, Missingno and Seaborn to gain insights into the distribution and correlation of features in the dataset. In particular, a heatmap using Seaborn was created to visualize the correlation matrix of the features.

**A Logistic Regression model** was trained using Scikit-Learn to predict the loan eligibility of customers based on their personal and financial information. The model was evaluated using accuracy metrics to ensure its performance.

The final model achieved an accuracy of **80.94%**, indicating its ability to predict loan eligibility with high accuracy. This project can be useful for banks and other financial institutions to streamline their loan approval process and reduce the risk of defaults.
